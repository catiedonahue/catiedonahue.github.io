    <h1>Welcome to Catie's Programming Portfolio Website!</h1>
    <p>My name is Catherine Donahue, but you can call me Catie. This web site is my portfolio <br>
      showcasing various projects I have completed throughout my time in CSC106, otherwise known
      as the Joy of Programming. I was able to create this webpage using th HTML programming <br>
      language. I am excited to learn more about programming, and for you to follow me on that <br>
      journey!</p>
