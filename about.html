    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hi, I'm Catie. I am currently a sophomore at the University of Rhode Island. I am a 
    double major in Computer Engineering and Computer Science, and I am interested in minoring in 
    Cyber Security. When I am also apart of the University's cheerleading team, as well as I am an
    U.S. Air Force ROTC cadet at the University of Connecticut's detachment. After commissioning I
    am hoping to become a Cyberspace Operations Officer and go career as an officer in the Air Force.
    
    In the little free time I like to spend as much time outside as I can, whether that's going for a run,
    hiking, walking my dog, or being by the water. I have three cats, two dogs so you could say I like the
    company of animals. To destress I enjoy singing, cooking, any type of physical fitness, or even a good 
    nap.</p>
